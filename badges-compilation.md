## Reflections

During the Microsoft TypeScript fundamentals mini-course, I learned several key concepts that will improve my programming skills.
1. how TypeScript helps prevent errors through static typing and simplifies code maintenance.
2. how to declare variables with specific types, helping avoid mistakes and improving code readability.
3. learning about interfaces taught me how to define object structures and ensure more predictable code.
4. I understood how to type functions to prevent errors with arguments and return values.
5. working with classes showed me how to organize code and apply object-oriented principles.
6. generics help create flexible and reusable components, improving code efficiency.
7. how to work with third-party libraries and manage their types in TypeScript.
8. how to organize code and avoid naming conflicts in larger projects.

**How the course has contributed to my skills**
Now I feel a bit more confident in trying to use TypeScript, and I know where to look to explore the topic further.
